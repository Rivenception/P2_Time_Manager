 # Employee Timesheet Manager
 ## Brian Garrity, Juliette Gondon, Rick Mingione

 ## Description 
 This is application serves tech workers and administrators who need to keep track of expenses and hours. Engineers don’t always have a punch-in punch-out method of logging their work hours, so this timesheet app offers a user friendly way to log hours and manage their expenses.

 A block formatted webpage that manages an employee database, where employees can log their work hours and productivity, as well as access their last 10 entries of time logged.

 Our engineered interface allows employees to adjust hours worked and submit a timesheet to the administrator, who also has their own view of the application from a management perspective. You can create and run reports for overtime hours and view a users past 10 timesheet entries. This tool can provide program managers and department heads the visibility of active projects and tasks completed in real time.
