Employee Timesheet Manager

A block formatted webpage that manages an employee database, their last 10 entries of time logged. This is going to function as a catchup and benefit tech workers as well as administrators and managers who need to keep track of expenses and hours. engineers don’t always have a punch-in punch-out method of logging their work hours, so this timesheet app would create a user friendly way to log hours and expenses. We are potentially entering an admin page so this would be secure for users. The user would enter their time and be given back their past logs. Eventually this application will be used on local servers by Franklin Products - an engineering company in the airline industry
